I have created two detailed markdown files for you:
1.  **`GEMINI_PRODUCT_MANAGEMENT_AND_MONGODB_GUIDE.md`**: This guide explains the logic for an administrator to add, modify, and delete products in the application. It also outlines the complexities and steps involved in migrating data storage to MongoDB.
2.  **`GEMINI_BACKEND_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`**: This guide details your current backend technology (Node.js with Express.js and MySQL via Prisma ORM) and provides a step-by-step plan for migrating to MongoDB.

Please review these documents for the information you requested.
I have finished the task.
